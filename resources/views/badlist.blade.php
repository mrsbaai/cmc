				  A Ponzi is any scheme which pays interest to "Investors" from Bitcoin coming in from new Investors.</br>
				  A HYIP (high yield investment program) is just a Ponzi.</br>
				  All Ponzi/Hyips will fail. The later Investors will lose everything when the scheme folds and leaves with the Bitcoin. </br>
				  Most HYIPS and doublers etc, just steal it immediately. You send it and they keep it. Due diligence is your own responsibility.</br>
				  There are plenty of good sites out there where your Bitcoin and your work are safe. You just need to do your homework, including checking here.</br>
				  If it isn't in our Badlist, <a href="/contact">Email Us</a>, and we'll check it and get back to you.
